Social Contact Display Widget

== Description ==

WP Creative have created a simple social contact display widget for your WordPress website. A very simple user interface allows you to easily update both your business address and your social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Plus, Pinterest and Instagram. The widget is modular, so you can choose which options you want to display.

You currently have 15 <a href="http://demo.wp-creative.co.uk/contact-display-widget/social-media-icons/">Social Media Icon Sets</a> to choose from and the list is being added to all the time.

We have also recently added lightweight pure HTML5 and CSS3 social media icon sets.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What has changed in Version 2? =

We have added a more advanced set of widgets. The options are entered via the settings page under "SCD Settings". We have kept the original widget but renamed it as "Simple Social Contact Display". This should keep all of your previous options, but you will need to re-add the widget itself.

Also added is a Google Map option. This is a static map, for now, and coordinates will need to be entered - <a href="https://support.google.com/maps/answer/18539?hl=en" target="_blank" >How to get coordinates</a>.
